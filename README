This is the repository for gertSVM, my parallel implimentation of the svm training method using the conjugate gradient method as described by Wen, Edelman, and Gorsich (2001).

The repository are divided as follows:

	Serial -- the serial implementation of the training method.

		test with: 
			$make test

	Parallel -- the parallel implementation of the training method.

		test with:
			$make testMP

	Datasets -- code to generate fake datasets for testing.
